# Prediction of diabetes using logistic regression

Logistic regression is a classification model in machine learning, extensively used in clinical analysis. It uses probabilistic estimations which help in understanding the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Diabetes, being one of the most common diseases around the world, when detected early, may prevent the progression of the disease and avoid other complications. In this work, we design a prediction model, that predicts whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset, and explore various techniques to boost performance and accuracy.

The first steps involve selecting the dataset for the model and evaluating its features. For this paper, the first dataset chosen is the PIMA Indian dataset. There are a total of nine features/variables, among which eight are predictor variables and 1 is the target variable. The features are as follows:

■Pregnancies: Number of times the patient was pregnant.

■Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over two hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

■BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

■SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).

■Insulin: Two-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).

■BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).

■DiabetesPedigreeFunction/DPF: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.

■Age: In years.

■Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic). This is the target variable.
